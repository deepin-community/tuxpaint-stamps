In this directory you'll find scripts for converting
the stamp description files to and from gettext PO files,
for use by translators.

Run the following two scripts (in this order) everytime
a stamp description is added or changed, or a translation
(PO file) is updated:

createpo.sh
createtxt.sh

Note: Never edit the translations in the .txt files,
or run the .py scripts directly.
